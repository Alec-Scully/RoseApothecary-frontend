This repo was the frontend of my [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) phase 5 capstone project. If you are looking for the backend of this project, you can find it here:

For this project I decided to create an e-commerse store for the Rose Apothecary - as seen on Netflix's Schitt's Creek.
To start we run:

```javascript
npm install
npm start
```

## User Stories:
  * A user should be able to see all the items in the store upon loading the page
  * A user should be able to click an item and be taken to that specific items page
  * A user should be able to sign-up or log-in/logout
  * A user should be able to automatically log-in if they have done so previously and not logged-out on the same device.
  * A user should be able to add, update, or remove items from their own personal cart
  
This frontend is made using React.

I decided to create this app to give myself a challenge. CSS was not a skill of mine prior to this project, and I tried to make this website look and feel as authentic as possible.
